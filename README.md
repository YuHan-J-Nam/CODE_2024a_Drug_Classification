CODE 2nd Cohort Open-Topic Project

Project Overview

Title: Drug Consumption Classification and Proposing Solutions for Drug Issues in Korea

Project Goal

This project aims to analyze personality traits associated with susceptibility to drug consumption and propose data-driven strategies to address the rising drug use in Korea, especially among adolescents.

Key Research Question

What types of personality traits make individuals more prone to drug use?

Methodology

We utilized a comprehensive dataset containing survey responses, including the Big Five personality traits (Neuroticism, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, Openness) and SS (Sensation-Seeking) scores.

The analysis involves categorizing respondents based on these traits to identify correlations with drug consumption vulnerability.

Significance

The rapid increase in drug-related offenses in Korea, particularly among youth, underscores the need for targeted preventive measures. This analysis aims to uncover personality markers that could guide interventions to curb the growth of drug addiction.

Tools and Libraries

Data processing and analysis were conducted using Python with libraries such as Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

Jupyter Notebook was used for an interactive analysis and visualization process.

Expected Outcomes

Insights into personality traits that indicate a higher risk of drug use.

Recommendations for policy-makers to develop targeted awareness and preventive programs for vulnerable groups.

This project contributes to understanding drug consumption patterns and informs solutions aimed at reducing the prevalence of drug abuse in Korea.
